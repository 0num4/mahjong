# Riichi mahjong hands calculation

We have a code which can calculate hand cost (han, fu, yaku and scores) 
based on the hand's tiles for riichi mahjong (japanese version of mahjong).

It supports features like:

- Disable\enable aka dora in the hand
- Disable\enable open tanyao yaku

The code was validated on tenhou.net phoenix replays in total on **8'527'296 hands**, and 
results were the same in 100% cases.

So, we can say that our own hand calculator works the same way that tenhou.net hand calculation.
